# Spec Kit

Toolkit for "Spec-Driven Development" — specifications become executable blueprints that generate working implementations.

**Repo:** https://github.com/github/spec-kit

## What It Does

- Inverts traditional development: spec-first, not code-first
- Provides structured workflow via slash commands
- Guides AI agents through: constitution → specify → plan → tasks → implement
- Generates production-ready applications from well-defined specs
- Cross-validates artifacts for consistency
- Works across multiple AI agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, etc.)

## Workflow Commands

- `/speckit.constitution` — define governing principles and standards
- `/speckit.specify` — articulate requirements and user stories
- `/speckit.plan` — create technical implementation strategy
- `/speckit.tasks` — generate actionable task breakdown
- `/speckit.implement` — execute all tasks systematically
- `/speckit.clarify` — resolve ambiguities
- `/speckit.analyze` — cross-artifact validation
- `/speckit.checklist` — quality verification

## Why Interesting

- Reduces "vibe coding" with structured approach
- Focus on intent (what) before implementation (how)
- Technology independent — works across languages/frameworks
- Could complement Claude Code's planning phase
- Official GitHub project — likely well-maintained
- Addresses the "AI generates inconsistent code" problem

## Integration Notes

- CLI tool: `uv tool install specify-cli`
- Initialize: `specify init <project-name> --ai claude-code`
- Uses slash commands integrated into AI agent workflows
- Creates structured documentation artifacts
- Agent interprets specs to generate implementations

## Status

Saved for evaluation — potentially useful for complex projects requiring rigorous specification phase before implementation. Could work alongside Claude Code's EnterPlanMode.
