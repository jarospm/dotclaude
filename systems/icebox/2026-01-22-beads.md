# Beads

Distributed, git-backed issue tracker designed specifically for AI coding agents.

**Repo:** https://github.com/steveyegge/beads
**Article:** https://steve-yegge.medium.com/introducing-beads-a-coding-agent-memory-system-637d7d92514a

## What It Does

- Replaces markdown task lists with structured dependency graphs
- Stores tasks as JSONL files in `.beads/` directory (versioned like code)
- Maintains persistent memory across long-running agent sessions
- Tracks task dependencies automatically
- Uses hash-based IDs (`bd-a1b2`) to prevent merge conflicts
- Supports hierarchical task structures (epics → tasks → subtasks)
- Implements "memory decay" — summarizes completed tasks to compress history

## Why Interesting

- Purpose-built for AI agents, not humans
- Outputs structured JSON instead of prose
- Eliminates context loss across extended workflows
- Conflict-free collaboration between multiple agents/branches
- Could complement Claude Code's TodoWrite for complex multi-session projects
- Addresses the "agent amnesia" problem for long-running tasks

## Integration Notes

- CLI tool: `beads` command
- Three operational modes:
  - **Stealth** — local-only use
  - **Contributor** — for forked repositories
  - **Maintainer** — full integration with write access
- Tasks stored as `.beads/*.jsonl` files
- Git-native workflow (commit, branch, merge)
- Agent can query which tasks are "ready for work" based on dependency graph

## Status

Saved for evaluation — potentially useful for complex, multi-session projects where TodoWrite's ephemeral nature becomes limiting.
